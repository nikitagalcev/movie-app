# Movie App

This is kind of pet-project. I created it just to play with technologies that I do not use in my work. I will extend this app step by step in my spare time. (Yes, I have some plans on it, hehe)

## Current stack
- React
- Typescript
- RxJS

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
